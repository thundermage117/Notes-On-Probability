\section{Probability Space}
There are often various approaches to probability each with its own advantages
and disadvantages.

Experiment is a procedure that can be infinitely repeated and has a
well-defined set of possible outcomes, known as the sample space.

The observation/result of the experiment are termed as outcomes.

\subsection{Classical Approach}
        Probability of an event $E$ is defined to be: $$P(E)=\frac{Number\; of\;
         outcomes\;in\; E}{Total\; number\; of\; outcomes}$$
         Some examples are tossing a coin or rolling a die.
         Disadvantages:
         \begin{itemize}
             \item Unable to model biases. It says nothing about cases where no
             physical symmetry exists.
             \item Doesn't deal with cases where total outcomes are infinite.
         \end{itemize}

         \subsection{Frequentist Approach}
         Also known as the relative frequency approach or frequentism. It defines
         an event's probability as the limit of its relative frequency in many
         trials.

         Probability is defined to be:
         $$ P(E)=\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n_E}{n}$$
         where an experiment is conducted $n$ times and event $E$ occurs $n_E$
         times.
         Disadvantages:
         \begin{itemize}
             \item It isn't efficient to conduct an experiment multiple times
             just to find the probability of an event occuring.
             \item It is unable to deal with subjective belief. Eg: Suppose a
             cricket expert says there is a $50\%$ of RCB winning the IPL this
             year. It doesn't mean that the RCB has won half the titles in the
             past.
         \end{itemize}

         \subsection{Axiomatic Approach}

         \subsubsection{Probability Space}

The triple ($S$, $F$, $P$) is referred to as a probability space where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$ : Sample space, set of all possible outcomes of the experiment.
    \item $F$ : Event Space, subset of the sample space
    \item $P$ : Probability Measure
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Sample Space}

$S$ can either be finite or countably infinite or uncountably infinite.

Examples for S:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Finite Sample Space: Single coin toss $ S=\{H,T\} $ and two coin tosses $ S=\{HH,HT,TT,TH\} $.
        \item Countably Infinite Sample Space: Keep tossing a coin till you get a head $ S=\{H,TH,TTH...\}$.
        \item Uncountably Infinite Sample Space: We have a circular dart board and we are measuring the angle at which a dart hits the board. $S=[0,2\pi]$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Event Space}
Collection of events is called an event space, there are some properties to be satisified such as:
it has to be a ``Sigma Field''.

\subsubsection{Sigma Field}
A sigma field (or sigma algebra) F is a collection of subsets of S which satisfies the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S \in F$
    \item If $E \in F$, then $E^C \in F$
    \item If $E_1,E_2,E_3 \cdots \in F $, then $\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_i \in F$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Examples for Event Space}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Smallest possible event space:
    $$ F =\{ \phi,S\} $$
    \item Next non-trivial event space:
    $$ F=\{ \phi,E ,E^c ,S\}$$
    \item If $E_1 \in F$ and $E_2 \in F$, then $E_1 \cap E_2 \in F$ (Proof in 1.4.3)
    \item For S=$\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ , $E_1 ={1,2}$ and $E_2={3,4}$. The smallest event space containing $E_1$ and $E_2$ is:
    $$ F=\{\phi , S, E_1 , E_{1}^{C},E_2 , E_{2}^{C},E_1 \cup E_2 , (E_{1} \cup E_{2})^{C}\}$$
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Proposition 1}
A$_1$, A$_2$, A$_3$,....A$_n$ $\in$ $F$, then $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n$A$_i$ $\in$ $F$.

\textbf{Proof: }If A$_1$, A$_2$, A$_3$,....A$_n$ $\in$ $F$, then A$_1^c$, A$_2^c$, A$_3^c$,....A$_n^c$ $\in$ $F$ and $\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n$A$_i^c$ $\in$ $F$. Then by property 2, $(\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^n$A$_i^c)^c$ = $\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^n$A$_i$ $\in$ $F$.

\subsubsection{Proposition 2}
A, B $\in$ $F$, then A$\setminus$B = A - B $\in$ $F$.\medskip

\textbf{Proof: }If B $\in$ $F$, then B$^c$ $\in$ $F$ by  property 2. So, A $\cap$ B$^c$ = A$\setminus$B $\in$ $F$ (As seen in proposition 1).

\subsection{Probability Measure}
The probability measure P is a function returning an event's probability. A probability is a real number between zero and one.
$$ P:F\rightarrow [0,1]$$

P has to satisfy the following 3 axioms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $P(E) \geq 0$
    \item $P(S)=1$
    \item If $E_1,E_2 \cdots \in F$ such that $E_i \cap E_j =\phi$ then:
    $$ P(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} E_{i})= \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} P(E_i)$$
\end{itemize}

For two disjoint sets:
$P(E_1 \cup E_2)= P(E_1)+P(E_2)+ \sum P(\phi)$

We will later see that $P(\phi)$ is indeed 0.

\subsection{Derived Properties of Probability}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $$P(E^C)=1-P(E)$$
        Proof:$$E \cup E^C = S$$
            $$P(E)+P(E^C)=1$$

    \item For any two events $E_1$ and $E_2$,
    $$ P(E_1 \cup E_2)= P(E_1)+P(E_2)-P(E_1 \cap E_2)$$
    Proof:
    $$ P(E_1 \cup E_2)=P(E_1)+P(E_2 \cap E_1^C)$$
    Now, $$ E_2=(E_2 \cap E_1)\cup (E_2 \cap E_1^C)$$
    $$ \Rightarrow P(E_2)=P(E_1 \cap E_2)+ P(E_1^C \cap E_2)$$
    Also,
    $$ P(E_1 \cup E_2)= P(E_1)+P(E_1^C \cap E_2)$$
    Substitute the required value in the final equation.
\end{enumerate}

Question:
$ S=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. 1 and 5 are equally likely and probability of getting a 6 is one-third.

Find minimum and maximum probability that we get an even number.

Answer:$$ Minimum \;Prob. = \frac{1}{3} \;\; when \;\; P_2 = P_4 = 0$$
$$ Maximum \;Prob. = 1,  \;\; P_2+P_4 =\frac{2}{3}  $$
